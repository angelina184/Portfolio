		<p>Drinking in the day’s first sip of coffee is like paradise massaging the taste buds. It is, as one coffee-in-a-can company figured out long ago, 
			the best part of waking up. For a single moment at your favorite coffee shop, or while your fingers hug your favorite mug in the kitchen, you’ve 
			been taken to the scene of your last vacation – the day’s worries momentarily melting away, letting you breathe in the serenity 
			of sunshine just as the caffeine smacks your brain.
		</p>
	<h2 class="upper">MAKING THE PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE REQUIRES TWO ELEMENTS:</h2>
	<h3>THE RIGHT COFEE & ROAST</h3>
		<p>Did you know there are over 800 tasting notes and potential flavors found naturally in coffee? The different roast levels of coffee greatly impact what 
			tasting notes you’ll be able to discover in the coffee you choose. Like fruity, berry, or tea-like flavors in your coffee... you should probably stick 
			to the lighter roasts. More of a bold, smokey, whiskey flavor lover? You probably should stick to the darker side of the roast spectrum. In the middle (medium roasts) 
			you’ll find a healthy dose of chocolate notes and a mix of everything in between.
		</p>
		<p>Freshness is also SUPER important. That’s why we roast all of our coffees to order (roasted and shipped) within 24 hours of an order.</p>
	<h1>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</h1>	
		<ul>
			<li>High-quality coffee beans</li>
			<li>French press</li>
			<li>Ground coffee</li>
			<li>Tablespoon or scale</li>
			<li>Kettle</li>
		</ul>	
	<h3>STEPS</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><h4>Measure your coffee.</h4></li>
			<p>The standard ratio is approximately 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. 
				Don’t be afraid to add a few extra beans to be on the safe side – you can more 
				approximately measure out your coffee using a scale after it’s ground.
			</p>
			<li><h4>Grind your coffee.</h4></li>
			<p>Alright, this is where the coffee-making process really begins. 
				Go for a finer roast if you want a sweeter cup of coffee, or a coarser 
				grind if you’re aiming for a satisfying, weighty bitter. Make sure the 
				grinder is clean before using, then feel free to press the magic button.
			</p>
