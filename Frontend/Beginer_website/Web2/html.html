    <h2>The world</h2>
    <p class="one">Animals are fascinating creatures that share our planet. They come in a vast array of shapes, sizes, and behaviors, ranging from tiny insects to massive whales. 
        Mammals, like lions and dolphins, are known for their intelligence and complex social structures. Birds captivate us with their ability to fly and their 
        vibrant plumage, such as parrots and eagles. Reptiles, like snakes and turtles, display incredible adaptability to various environments. Amphibians, like frogs and salamanders,
         live both on land and in water. Insects, though small, play crucial roles in ecosystems, such as pollination by bees. Fish, dwelling in oceans and rivers, exhibit 
         an extraordinary diversity of forms and colors.
         Animals not only enrich our lives but also help maintain the balance of nature. Protecting them is essential for preserving biodiversity and the planet's health.</p>
